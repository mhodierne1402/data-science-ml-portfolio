# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

The world changes so fast now that everyone is likely to find themselves questioning their original career choices. I tell my children to follow their hearts and do what they love - one is a sculptor and the other an actor. So why can't I say I'm doing what I love? Advances in AI and machine learning have strongly attracted me to revisit my earlier technical career, although the landscape looks quite different now. I feel compelled to "hop over" and take part in this exciting field.

I have completed an intensive data science, machine learning, and AI skills program to build a foundation. However, applying this knowledge through concrete projects is critical for development. I plan to tackle problems I don't yet know how to solve, like a project to generate captions for images. Working through such real-world problems will take my learning to the next level.

These notebooks document my exploration. As such, they not only offer solutions to challenges, but also share my thought process and capture my learning. I trust readers will appreciate my starting point rather than expect "perfect" solutions.

My work here will be far from polished, but that's okay. This exploration will open doors to new ideas demanding further investigation. I can't wait to see where it leads! Please enjoy following my journey as I work to translate my passion into a new career in this dynamic field.
