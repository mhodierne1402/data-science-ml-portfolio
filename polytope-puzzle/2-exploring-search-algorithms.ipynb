I confirmed my thoughts that a graph search algorithm would serve me well for this type of permutation puzzle. The initial and solution states would be vertices of the graph and the allowed moves would be the edges of the graph. Given an initial vertex and a solution vertex, I will need to find the shortest path between them, that is, the path with the fewest number of edges, or moves.  \n",
