# The Polytope Permutation Puzzle - a Kaggle Competition
**An exploration of traditional heuristic search methods.**

- Probably well beyond my capabilities to solve this puzzle, but I'm using it as an opportunity to re-learn and apply graph search algorithms.
- I will compare performance with other algorithms such as Breadth First Search, A* and IDA* search. I will learn about heuristic search and methods of optimization.
