# The Polytope Permutation Puzzle - a Kaggle Competition
**An exploration of traditional heuristic search methods.**

- A Rubik's cube-like solution challenge, except that the puzzles come in a variety of geometric shapes.
- Heuristic graph search algorithms and methods of optimization.
- Comparing the performance of Breadth First, A*, and IDA* search.
